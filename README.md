# Loihi-2-SNNs-Classification
We developed low-power ALIF spiking neural networks (SNNs) for bird vocalization classification using the Lava framework with a Loihi-2 compatible architecture. Achieving 203 μJ inference with a 128-64-10 network, our work generates HDF5 models ready for deployment on Intel’s Loihi-2 chip, though all evaluations were conducted in simulation within Lava.
